# Jama Software Technical Problem

Review the following technical problem. There are few basic requirements in the form of acceptance criteria but the design is completely open ended. This should be written entirely in client side languages, run in any modern browser (not including IE), and work without a server. The solution should be delivered via a git repo (preferred) or zip file.

Please consider testability, documentation, and other good coding practices in your solution.

## The Problem:
As a user, I need a way to keep track of a list of tasks that I need to do today, so that I can keep on task.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. View a list of tasks that I have previously created

2. Add new tasks

3. Mark tasks as being “done”

4. Remove old tasks

5. Edit tasks

## Bonus: 
1. Persist tasks through session

2. Share tasks with others

3. Restore removed tasks.
